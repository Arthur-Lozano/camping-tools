# Software Requirements
### Vision

## What is the vision of this product?

 ### An app that takes in user information for a camping trip and items they may or may not have. Output would be a recommended tools/supplies/food. Stretch goals for this could be additional items for them to get that they might be missing based on their previous answers.
### Side Thoughts -- Rather than location, look at the type of camping (drop down), then output suggested items they would need / links to guides etc. -- Packing list style. Could continue to add in stretch goals.
### Stretch Goals - additional pages as an option.
