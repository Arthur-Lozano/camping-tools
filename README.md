## An app that takes in user information for a camping trip and items they may or may not have. Output would be a recommended location for them to go to. Stretch goals for this could be additional items for them to get that they might be missing based on their previous answers.
## Side Thoughts -- Rather than location, look at the type of camping (drop down), then output suggested items they would need / links to guides etc. -- Packing list style. Could continue to add in stretch goals. Stretch Goals - additional pages as an option.
