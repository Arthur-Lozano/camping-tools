      <h2><a href="https://parks.state.wa.us/535/Lake-Wenatchee" class="contentRspot">Lake Wenatchee State Park</a></h2>
      <p>My favorite spot to camp is the senic and fairly well-hidden Lake Wenatchee State Park, roughly 30 minutes away from the famous town of Leavenworth, WA. Year round, the state park is an amazing place to take in nature and become one with your spirit guide. During the summer, camping near the lake or the Wenatchee river that flows from the park with a steady current, makes for some epic river floating, swimming and BBQ feasts with family and friends. Tent camping is abound, both in the park and the surrounding areas. Switch gears to the chilly winter season, cabin, car and snow camping are still a blast, with tons of snowshoeing & hiking all around as you take in the mirror like quality of the lake or watch the snow fall.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If you need a break from the outdoor adventures, local favorites spots like Plain Hardware or Plain Cellars is the perfect way to enjoy the surrounding areas will you brows local oddities or sip a delicious rose. Mentioned above, Leavenworth is only a short drive away. Offering beautiful views of the surrounding mountains all year long and featuring some of the best Christmas festivities during the holiday season.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/shi-shi-beach-and-point-of-arches" class="contentAspot">Shi Shi Beach and Point of the Arches</a></h2>
      <p>Shi Shi (pronounced Shy Shy) Beach is amazing. My friends and I take this trip almost every year. we take WA 112, which is a fun, winding road with breathtaking views of the ocean. To backpack overnight on Shi Shi Beach you will need a Makah Recreation Pass. The hike to Shi Shi Beach is relatively easy, at times muddy, and contains 1 very steep hill. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The sites can be private with a great ocean view. In the morning the tide pools are amazing! Colorful starfish and sea anemones everywhere. I highly recommend visiting and spending the night!</p>

      <h2><a href="https://google.com" class="contentArspot">Barclay Creek Trail head</a></h2>
      <p>This is a hiking area in Snohomish County, Washington</p>
      <br>
      <p>This is a 4.4 mile trail roundtrip to Barclay Lake which provides beautiful views of the pacific north west. This is a very popular trial and I would recommend going on a weekday if possible to avoid traffic especially during times such as these. The trial has a gain of 500ft of elevation over the course of the hike.  There are various places to camp located all around the trail but also some along the trail.  The location is (Central Cascades -- Stevens Pass - West)</p>
