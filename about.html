      <p>My name is Arthur Lozano and I recently moved to Seattle from Germany, but I am originally from Chicago, IL. I
        retired out of Germany from the United States Air Force and thought that there wasn’t a more beautiful place
        than the state of Washington to live in. I have an associate as a webmaster and my focus for my master’s degree
        was in website development.</p>

        <p>My name is Ryan Tipper and am a born and raised Washington native. Having spent my entire life in the PNW, I
          am often still in awe at the sights of the mountains and trees around us. I have been, and still today,
          playing baseball since I was five years old. I am also a published childrens author and aspiring novelist in
          my spare time. I am super excited to continue my venture into the world of Software Development!</p>
