      <p>My name is Arthur Lozano and I recently moved to Seattle from Germany, but I am originally from Chicago, IL. I retired out of Germany from the United States Air Force and thought that there wasn’t a more beautiful place than the state of Washington to live in. I have an associate as a webmaster and my focus for my master’s degree was in website development so I thought I would try to actually move into this career now that my military time is complete. Code fellows is giving me the actual hands on experience that I need and I look forward to adding more tools to my tool belt. I look forward to my journey in coding and meeting amazing people along the way.</p>

      <p>My name is Ryan Tipper and am a born and raised Washington native. Having spent my entire life in the PNW, I am often still in awe at the sights of the mountains and trees around us. I have been, and still do, playing baseball since I was five years old. I am also a published childrens author and aspiring novelist in my spare time. I am super excited to continue my venture into the world of Software Development!</p>
